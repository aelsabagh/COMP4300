                          ----------------------
                                  Files
                          ----------------------
Folders:
- /batch: used to store files used by run.sh to automate submitting jobs to PBS
- /batch/output: used to store output files generated by run.sh (see below)

Automation files:
- make (used to compile)
- run.sh (used to automatically submit jobs to PBS and generate results output)
- print.c (used by run.sh)

Files for implementation and performance testing:
- ass1.c
- ass1.h
- harness.c
- summa.c
- summa.h

Information files:
- README.txt: this file.

                          ----------------------
                                How to Run
                          ----------------------
IMPORTANT: When run.sh is executed, all output and errors will be in the
/batch/output folder. Files will be of the format:
- output_np.txt, or
- error_np.txt where np = no. of processors (i.e. 01, 02, 04, 08, 16, or 32).
------------------
1. Easiest Method
------------------
Command: ./run.sh
The easiest way is to run the shell script "run.sh" by running the above
command from the root directory of the assignment.

Note: To save time, the code for the naive approach is commented out in
harness.c to avoid execution. It is quite slow!

This will:
- Put jobs for 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 processors, for all matrix sizes mentioned
  in WRITEUP.pdf.
- Automatically create two files for each batch_job file.
  + First file is output_np.txt where "np" is no. of processors. This file will
    have the output results.
  + Second file is error_np.txt where "np" is no. of processors. This file will
    have output of any errors encountered during execution by PBS.

--------------------
2. Selective Method
--------------------
Edit run.sh to select which processors you'd like to test the code for.
Then, run run.sh as per method 1 above.

----------------------------------
3. Selective Method for np <= 16
----------------------------------
Edit the source code (harness.c and ass1.c) to test individual blocks of
code or to test the code for processors other than those used in run.sh
